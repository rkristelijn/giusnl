This is just a personal github repository to stash my code. If you need a template to start of your website, feel free to use my code. Also I'm happy to receive comments. My aim is to create a responsive, if possible progressive web app to manage my blog posts. Before I wrote any code I wrote this.

## Mission statement
Create a good template, with the least amount of code that is as light as possible that delivers the most tidy result.

# Plan
- step 1: create a github, stash my code
- step 2: create a app shell, so it loads my stuff, potentially using HTML5 cache
- step 3: create some static content
- step 4: create a rest service to be able to manage my content
